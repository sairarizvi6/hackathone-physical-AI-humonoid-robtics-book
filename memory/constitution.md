# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Project Constitution

## Purpose
This constitution defines the core principles, engineering standards, governance model, and ethical framework
for creating a production-grade technical textbook and intelligent learning system for Physical AI and
Humanoid Robotics.

## Core Principles

### Interdisciplinary Collaboration
The project must be developed through collaborative work across Artificial Intelligence,
Robotics Engineering, Biomechanics, Cognitive Science, Human Factors Psychology, and Ethics.
All modules must reflect systems-level integration across disciplines.

### Ethical AI Development
All content and intelligent systems must prioritize human well-being, autonomy, privacy,
fairness, bias detection, explainability, transparency, and accountability.
The project must reject any designs that compromise safety, rights, or dignity.

### Robustness & Safety Engineering
Systems must be engineered for extreme reliability and resilience in unpredictable environments.
The project must include risk assessment frameworks, fault-tolerant design principles, and
simulation-backed safety verification.

### Human–Robot Interaction Design
The project must emphasize intuitive, natural, and trustworthy interfaces between humans and robots,
considering psychological comfort, social norms, and cultural perspectives.

### Continuous Learning & Adaptation
All Physical AI systems discussed in this textbook must embody principles of lifelong learning,
real-time adaptation, and self-improving behavior through real-world interaction.

## Technical Standards
The project must adopt industry-aligned standards for simulation-based development,
digital-twin modeling, hardware–software co-design, and real-time robotic middleware.

## Research & Development Workflow
Development must follow an iterative, hypothesis-driven scientific workflow with
peer review cycles, verifiable experiments, and knowledge transfer practices
across engineering and academic communities.

## Governance
